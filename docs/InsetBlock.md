## Inset Block

This is a dummy component and shouldn't be used. It's only for **demo**. The primary goal of the module tabs UI pattern is to permit users to view a group of
related data one at a time:

### Rules


- Tabs should not wrap, but when they do they will turn into a dropdown.
- Not explicitly used to indicate progress, but can help user  understand the breadth
of content on the page.
- Tabs should not show results, so summary of results should be outside. For
example a form's inputs can be broken down into tabs, with the summary/results
of the form shown outside as a separate component.
- One tab should not rely on another tab to make sense.

Here is some _lovely_ ***markdown*** [though](http://www.google.com)!
