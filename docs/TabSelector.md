# Tabs

* Tabs should not wrap, but when they do they will turn into a mobile friendly dropdown
* Tabs should not be be used to indicate progress, but can help users understand the breadth of content on the page
* Tabs should not contain the end or final result, these should be outside of any tabs. For example a form's inputs can be contained within tabs with the summary or results shown outside of these as a separate component
* One tab should not rely on another tab to make sense
