# Tabs

Not explicitly used to indicate progress, but can help user understand the breadth of content on the page.

Tabs should not show results, so summary of results should be outside the tab component. For example a form's inputs can be broken down into tabs, with the summary/results of the form shown outside as a separate component.
One tab should not rely on another tab to make sense

Tabs will not wrap, but when they do they will turn into a dropdown or equivalent mobile friendly layout.
