# Buttons

## Primary Button

* Primary / next action button
* Can have more that one, providing they are all next actions
* For example if there is a 'Save' page that asks the user to Login or Register, they should both be yellow as they are the same prominence

## Secondary Button

* Prominent steps, but lower priority than primary
* For example: Back button, Alternative steps

## Tertiary Button

* Simple text link
* Used for everything else
